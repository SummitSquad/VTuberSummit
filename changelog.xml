  <title>Version 1.02 (10/3/2023)</title>
  <desc>NEW INSTRUCTIONS FOR PATCHING:

You no longer need to manually patch in order to use the latest update.

If you already have downloaded and extracted the base game:
Download the Automatic Launcher zip file. Extract the contents to the directory where VTuberSummit.exe is. Then, run VTuberSummit.exe to automatically patch and/or run the game.

If you are downloading the game for the first time ever:
The Automatic Launcher will already be included in the game files. Follow the normal installation/runtime instructions as provided on the main page and you'll be good to go.
